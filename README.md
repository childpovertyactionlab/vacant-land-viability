# vacant-land-viability

Overview
Welcome to the Dallas County Vacant Lots Shiny App! This interactive tool is designed to explore and analyze vacant lots within Dallas County, focusing on those owned by public entities or faith-based organizations. Our goal is to identify properties with the highest potential for conversion into affordable housing, leveraging their tax benefits and potential for community collaboration.

Project Focus
The app specifically targets vacant land owned by public entities and faith-based organizations. 

Data
Data is sourced from the Dalla County Appraisal District, at www.dallascad.org. The datasets used are 2024 Parcels from deeds filed with Dallas County Clerk, and 2024 Data Files with Proposed Values (now called 2024 Certified Data Files with Supplemental Changes).
